there are three exceptions when
trying to find the ahref tag in
wikipedia website.

--1. the <p> tag may be described as
     mw-empty-tag which translates into
    meaning that it's '\n' in string
--2. when iterating through a <p>, <a>
    may have a href link to a "Help:wikipedia"
--3. every find_all for elements are
    returned as lists.
--4. iterate through every legit href link to
    next url.
    this will create a tree structure
